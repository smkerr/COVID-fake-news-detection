The catch? The pipelines needed to send antigen test results to health officials are brand new. It‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll never know just how many people with positive antigen results should have been counted as probable cases. https://t.co/a3Scc3BZyv
"What we found was that a state‚Äôs testing strategy played an important role in shaping probable case counts. States with strong antigen testing programs no longer had to rely on contact tracing and symptom tracking, both difficult to perform at scale."
"When states started updating their probable case definitions, as per guidance from the feds, the share of probable cases in their total case counts grew. Our research set out to explore the extent to which this growth was fueled by antigen tests alone."
"As we‚Äôve seen with many COVID-19 metrics, there‚Äôs often a veneer of uniformity obscuring quiet data discrepancies. In this piece, we look at probable COVID-19 case definitions and the decisions states made about how and when to adopt federal guidance. https://t.co/94W6uMQDPp"
The inability to track death trends when it mattered most speaks to some of the greatest failures in the US handling of COVID-19: the incalculable tragedy of the lost lives &amp; the infrastructure unable to collect data that might have informed a response and prevented such loss.
"Twice, the nation‚Äôs infrastructure was so overwhelmed that the death tally hit a ceiling, reflecting how many deaths out of the true total the US could count. Large backlogs of deaths from the winter were still being processed 4 months after the true peak."
"Real-time death counts were affected by both slowness in reporting, which made peaks in deaths appear like they happened later than they did, and by reporting capacity limits, which made deaths look like they peaked lower than they did."
"To understand the effect of reporting lags on state COVID-19 death counts, we compared data compiled by the CDC from state dashboards to retrospective data published by some states that charts deaths on the day they actually occurred. https://t.co/jP6gufJR1M"
